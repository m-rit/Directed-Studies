# Directed-Studies

In this research, I analyze Concurrent Session Injection (CSI) attacks, a class of threats targeting Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) systems. These attacks exploit user interaction patterns and malware at the client side to bypass MFA protections, posing a significant risk to authentication security.

I investigate the weaknesses of existing MFA mechanisms and propose defensive strategies to mitigate CSI attacks. My approach focuses on enhancing security within the userâ€™s terminal, where distinguishing between legitimate and malicious actions is more feasible.
