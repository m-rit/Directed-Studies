In this research, I analyze Concurrent Session Injection (CSI) attacks, a class of threats targeting Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) systems. These attacks exploit user interaction patterns and malware at the client side to bypass MFA protections, posing a significant risk to authentication security.

I investigate the weaknesses of existing MFA mechanisms and propose defensive strategies to mitigate CSI attacks. My approach focuses on enhancing security within the user’s terminal, where distinguishing between legitimate and malicious actions is more feasible.
